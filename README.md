# ImageJPlugins

This repository contains ImageJ Plugins that have been generated as part of the OMEGA project.
Specifically, the repository contains:

	1. *The OMEGAImageBrowser plugin*
	
	2. *The OMEGAImageImporter plugin*
	
This repository contains the source code for several programs that can be used to generate artificial trajectories of known mobility characteristics (i.e. observed Diffusion constant and Moment Scaling Spectrum; Ewers et al., 2005):

1. *TrajectoryGenerator*: this Matlab routine was developed by Vanni Galli and Alessandro Rigano as a modification of the *artificialTrajectory2* method that was initially developed to produce artificial trajectories by Sbalzarini and co-workers (Helmuth et al., 2007).
